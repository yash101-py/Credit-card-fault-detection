# Credit-card-fault-detection
I have made a machine learning algorithm for credit card fault detection.

This includes everything from :-
1. Cleaning
2. Preprocessing
3. Trainning
4. Validating

I have used the following libraries to create it:-
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn
4. Pylab
5. Tensorflow
6. Matplotlib
7. Seaborn

I have compared different method in order to provide a total understanding as based on the features which algorithm works best.
